# vdist
R package to visualize probability distributions

Overall idea:  make one-line code wrappers to visualize probability distributions, and 
name those functions similarly to dnorm, pnorm, dbinom, pbinom, etc.

Version 0.0.1
started writing packages!
added vnorm() function

Future plans:
add vexp(), vgeom(), vbinom(), vpois() functions and some "centered" versions
